# Introduction to Talus

Since ChatGPT's launch in late 2022, the AI sector has experienced a Cambrian explosion of attention and innovation. This breakthrough showcased the potential for dramatically enhanced user-facing AI systems, unleashing builders' creativity worldwide. Yet the promised disruption of our economy and daily lives by AI systems hasn't fully materialized. While large language models (LLMs) are powerful, they remain relatively limited when used in isolation. As a response, we enter the era of AI agents and Talus is leading the way to shape the agentic future.

**Note**: the definition of AI agents is the topic of a more rigorous discussion below, but for now one may simply think of an AI agent as _an AI system that is able to autonomously perform (complex) tasks for users_.

> At Talus, it is **our mission to unite our community in building AI agents** that revolutionize digital experiences **to serve everyone**.

We believe AI agents have the potential to revolutionize how users experience the internet. Given this transformative power, it's crucial that we build these AI technologies with fundamental values at their core. These values will determine whether we create a future that truly empowers users or one that further amplifies the exploitative patterns we've seen in Web2.

_So what are those values?_ To answer this question, let’s first consider the limitations of the current state of AI (agents).

### The AI Agent Bottleneck

Web2 agents struggle with resource access, cross-platform communication, and fragmented tooling. Web2's walled gardens lack the infrastructure and incentives for cross-platform collaboration. Its human-centric infrastructure limits AI agents' autonomous operation. Current tools are inadequate, and developers are still learning to utilize these systems effectively.

Key challenges include:

* **Closed Nature:** Web2 systems lack transparency in AI processes, making it impossible to verify model authenticity or output integrity.
* **Composability Issues:** Platform isolation prevents AI agents from collaborating effectively. For example, Alexa and Google Assistant can't easily work together, leading to inefficient and fragmented operations.
* **Information/API Fragmentation:** Different platforms use unique APIs and data formats, forcing developers to write custom code for each integration. This makes agent deployment complex and time-consuming.
* **Owner-Imposed Barriers:** CAPTCHAs and other anti-bot measures block AI agents from accessing services, limiting their effectiveness.
* **No Permissionless Payment Rails:** Complex permissions and non-standardized systems make it difficult for agents to handle financial interactions autonomously.

To overcome these challenges and make AI agents the next big thing, we need to shift towards infrastructure that offers seamless integration, standardization, and autonomous functionality across decentralized ecosystems.

### AI x Crypto

Looking at the shortcomings of the Web2 AI Agent sector, we can identify the values that would unlock the potential of AI agents for a user-centric, AI agent powered internet.

{% hint style="success" %}
**What the AI agent space should be…**

1. Open
2. Transparent
3. Censorship Resistant
4. Secure
5. Composable
6. Fair
7. Tied to a native value layer (i.e., defined onchain).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

These values will be familiar to the attentive reader. They are precisely the values that Web3 and blockchain champion—and the same values that AI technology must now embrace.

Beyond sharing these values, blockchain technology introduces a crucial new capability for AI: autonomous value transfer. Thus blockchain infrastructure enables the “agentic economy”. By leveraging blockchain infrastructure, we can create an efficient, interoperable ecosystem of AI agents working together intelligently.

At the same time, we believe AI will be the catalyst for the elusive _mass crypto adoption_. Until now, the complexity of interacting with DeFi protocols has kept its transformational potential limited to a privileged, knowledgeable minority. However, by putting AI agents at the user’s disposal, we can see the masses finally leveraging its benefits.

### The Talus Vision

Talus has a vision of AI agents powering a new age of user-centric internet. We stand to serve the user. That is our goal. However, we realize that achieving this mission will require collaboration. Therefore we are building applications directly for users, but also the infrastructure and tooling that will empower an ecosystem of developers to create best-in-class AI-enhanced applications for the user.

To that end, **Talus** is the onchain platform for AI agents while **Nexus** is the developer framework for building these agents.

The AI agent space is broad and competitive, but we see the unique market opportunity to augment AI agents with the unique value proposition blockchains offer. A distinctive approach, the Talus way. _For our community of users, by our community of developers, together with our partners._
